The type of question (radio/checkbox/textbox) is inferred from the presence or absense of checkboxes and the number of checked answers. One checked box results in a radio button-style question, where only one answer can be selected by the quiz-taker; while multiple checked answers results in a checkbox-style question, where more than one answer can be selected.

Note that the correct answer(s) should **always** be the first in the list of choices
